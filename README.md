# MedNEX

### What is MedNEX
  - MedNEX is a platform for communication between doctors and patients
  - The platform allows the patient to send a request for a consultation with doctors of his choice
  - The platform allows the patient to send a request that to reach all doctors, with specified by medical competencies, and then be connected with the first specialist to accept the request
  - The platform supports chat, as chat rooms are created when the doctor accepts the request
  - After completing the consultation (the doctor chooses when to stop) the patient has the opportunity to rate the doctor from 1 to 5.
  - The average rating of the medical specialist from all consultation is visible for each user (patient)

### Why?
The idea of MedNEX is to quickly and easily meet people in need, with the right medical professionals. Something that due to increased demand for this type of service and their limited supply, is becoming increasingly difficult.
